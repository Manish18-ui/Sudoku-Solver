# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a Sudoku Solver developed for my Vityarthi assignment. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any valid 4X4 Sudoku puzzle. The program takes a partially filled grid as input and outputs a fully solved Sudoku. Clean, efficient, and easy to understand for beginners learning recursion and algorithm design.
